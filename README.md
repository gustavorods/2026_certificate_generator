# Certificate Generator

**Tagline:** Generate customizable certificates dynamically in the browser using Angular.

## Description

Certificate Generator is a web application built with **Angular, HTML, CSS, and TypeScript** that allows users to **create personalized certificates** quickly and intuitively. Through a simple form, the user can enter a name and describe the completed activities, generating a certificate instantly. **Each certificate is automatically saved in the browser’s localStorage**, allowing it to be viewed later on the certificate page, and can also be downloaded as a ready-to-use file.
This project aims to simplify certificate generation for online courses, workshops, and events without depending on external servers or databases.
